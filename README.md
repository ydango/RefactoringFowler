# Refactoring Fowler
A C# translation from JavaScript of the examples in Martin Fowler's ["Refactoring"](https://martinfowler.com/articles/refactoring-2nd-changes.html) :book:, 2nd Edition

## How the Code is translated
The C# code follows the JavaScript as closely as possible

The C# code should be "good style", specifically [ReSharper](https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper) should have no warnings

## Target Environment
.NET Core 2.1

### Build

### Dependencies
* C# .NET Core using [SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download) v2.1+
